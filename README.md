# accessarticle
This is a LaTeX document class that inherits the aricle class and is enhanced to meet UA-1 accessibility standards.

 * See `demo.tex` for an example
 * See `demo.pdf` for an example output
 * Copy `accessarticle.cls` to your project folder or in your personal TeX directory tree
 * Follow the example in `demo.tex` for the LaTeX preamble, which includes universal access metadata, the syntax for declaring the document class, and the means for setting the title, author, and date
 * You must build LaTeX documents using this class with `lualatex`. Using `pdflatex` or another TeX engine will result in a build error.
